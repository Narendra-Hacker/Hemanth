5. Write a Java program that uses a for loop to display all the orders for a specific customer. 

public class OrderDisplay {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulated order data
        String[] orders = {"Order1", "Order2", "Order3"};
        String customerName = "CustomerName";

        System.out.println("Orders for " + customerName + ":");
        for (String order : orders) {
            System.out.println(order);
        }
    }
}

6. Implement a while loop to track the real-time location of a courier until it reaches its destination.

public class CourierTracking {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulated courier tracking
        String currentLocation = "StartLocation";
        String destination = "DestinationLocation";

        System.out.println("Tracking Courier...");

        while (!currentLocation.equals(destination)) {
            System.out.println("Current Location: " + currentLocation);
            // Simulated movement to the next location
            // In a real-world scenario, this would involve updating the courier's location in the database
            // and obtaining the new location.
            currentLocation = getNextLocation(currentLocation);
        }

        System.out.println("Courier has reached the destination: " + destination);
    }

    private static String getNextLocation(String currentLocation) {
        // Simulated method to get the next location
        // In a real-world scenario, this would involve more sophisticated logic.
        // For simplicity, let's assume a linear movement from StartLocation to DestinationLocation.
        if (currentLocation.equals("StartLocation")) {
            return "Location1";
        } else if (currentLocation.equals("Location1")) {
            return "Location2";
        } else if (currentLocation.equals("Location2")) {
            return "DestinationLocation";
        } else {
            // Handle unknown locations
            return currentLocation;
        }
    }
}
